<p><b>About</b><br>
I was born on October 17, 2003, and lived in the middle of the Massachusetts suburbs near the 
medium-sized city of Worcester. I lived there for over 18 years of my life before moving to
Chicago, Illinois in August 2022 to pursue higher education. I am a huge 
public transit nerd, as well as a photographer. My efforts with public transit have earned me the 
titles of being a saint, wizard, and "the fare reformer" (the last was once enthusiastically exclaimed 
by a friend of mine at Chicago's Union Station). I currently aspire to be a transit planner in the future. 
I use they/he pronouns.</p>
